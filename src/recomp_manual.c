/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

 * the kernel timer thread, and lifted code hands over the guest lock at any
 * function entry, so the vblank count could move between D3D computing a
 * flip's target vblank and checking it. D3D retires a flip only when the
 * count *equals* its target, so that flip stayed pending forever and
 * PersistDisplay, which waits for pending flips, never returned: the hang
 * starting a Quick Race or Career. Run at DISPATCH_LEVEL (the dispatch lock,
 * kernel_hal.c), neither can be interrupted by the other.
